Copy Vagrantfile.sample into your base directory and rename to Vagrantfile

    $ cd path/to/base/directory
    $ cp ./Vagrantfile.sample path/to/base/directory/Vagrantfile

Then you should be able to just do

    $ vagrant up

And have a working base php dev box with nginx, php, and phpunit ready to go, edit the Vagrant
file to your heart's content to get your environment how you like it
